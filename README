Programming PRPR requires following software.

Ruby.
Racc.(if you build own PRPR)
Python.

How to use.
move progprpr dir.

$ ./prpr <file>.
Like ruby,you can use stdin.

syntax.
you can use following mathmatic syntax.

a + b.
 -> return a plus b.
a - b.
 -> return a minus b.
a * b.
 -> return a multiple b
a / b.
 -> return a divide b.

a mod b.
 -> return remainder of "a divide b".
-calc remainder.
-ex. 5 mod 4 is 1.
     4.5 mod 3 is 1.5.
-in some other programming language,
 mod is %.

a ^ b.
-cal power.
-ex. 5^3 means 5*5*5.
-in some other programming language,
 ^ is **.

a is b.
 -> return true if a=b.false if a not = b.
-ex,5is5 return true.
 4 is 3 return false.
-in some other programming language,
 "is" is ==.


In prpr,there is no difference intger and float.
It means,there is only float.
Prpr also have strings.

"String".
-> return "String".
-In prpr,no high function for strings.
-Because,prpr is for mathmatics.
-but,I'm planning to add some functions.


In prpr,there is "for" and "if".
There is no document now.
Because prpr is now on work.
Sorry.

But you can see fizzbuzz.bas.
There are some sample for "for" and "if".
